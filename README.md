<h2>This project helps in setting up the esp32 for home automation </h2> 

<p> In this project we convert the esp32 microcontroller into web server which enable us to control through the web browser as connected to the same wifi network </p>

<p>the best way to see the ip address of the esp32 is by upload a basic wifi connecting example code from arduino IDE update the ssid and password of the wifi network and upload after that checking the ipaddress of it through the D-link/AnyRouter setting page => connected devices  ! . Generally settings page it starts with example : http://192.168.0.1/ </p>

<p> project 1 : in this project we create a esp32 as web server to on/off  an led with on/off buttons and also button with 2 min and 5 min these button will on the esp32 as per the time period and automatically off the led   </p>
